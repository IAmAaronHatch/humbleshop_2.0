What is "humble shop"?
    "humble shop" is a personalized shopping application that features personal self-designed products, such as shirts, jackets, and stickers. This application will allow customers to browse through various pages of specified items, add items to a cart, and "checkout" with the use of stripe.

<h2> Motivation </h2>
<hr>
I created this project to better understand the fundementals of react through a shop-based application. I will be incorporating designing skills to create new "products" that would act as clothing I would personally like to sell.

<h2> Tech/framework used </h2>
<hr>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

What are the main installs?
    This react project will include mainly redux, axios, bootstrap, react-router and redux-promise-middleware for the frontend Development. For the backend development: express, body-parser, express-session and massive. 

    Redux will be key for containing state and allowing props to be passed throughout components easier. 
    Axios will be used to make external and internal api calls.
    Bootstrap will be featured mainly in the cart component, allowing for small pop-ups about the product, etc.
    react-router will allow the react app to switch between various pages effortlessly, skiipping loading times and allowing the site to flow smoothly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
